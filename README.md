### Wire Frame

### User Stories: 
A fun memory matching game for any sneakerhead! Upon starting, the user must click on any card. The user will then have to flip another card to see if it matches the first flipped card. Keep flipping any two cards to find the same pair of shoes. 1 point will be given for every pair of sneakers matched. The game ends when you have found all matching pairs of sneakers or when the timer runs out.

### MVP Goals: 
* User must be able to click on any tile to reveal first image
* Usesr should be able to see the first image revealed then click on a second tile to reveal second image
* User should be able to see their score each time they find a matching pair
* User should be able to see their move count every time they don't find a pair
* User should be able to complete game before timer runs out
* User should see winning alert screen once all pairs have been found

### Stretch Goals
* Create a more responsive game
* Allow users to choose level of difficulty 
* Allow users to have fun playing game

## Game Functionality 
When the game loads, player can choose any square of their choosing. 
Once they choose, timer will start. 
Player must then click on a second tile to reveal image.
 If the two images are a match, 1 point will be added. 
 If it is not a match, 1 move count will be added. 
 Player must find all matching pairs before the timer runs out. 

### Technology Used

* CSS
* Javascript

## Unsolved Problems
* I was not able to implement the timer, move count, and scoreboard
* I was not able to implement a "you win" alert when player completes game
* Could not disable double clicking 
* Slight delay if clicking too fast 

## Project Difficulties
Being that I have little to no experience, this was my first project I was able to work on independently. Although it was not as reponsive as I wish it could be, I am glad that I was able to get the cards to flip and match. Difficulties within this project was definitely trying to get the game to function. Even if I had chosen a simple game, it sure felt advanced to me since I am new to all this. 


## Future Goals
* Add a start up screen
* Adding more features to the game (difficulty level, sounds, etc etc)
* Figure out how to make game mobile-friendly
